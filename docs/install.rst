Installation
============

The quickest way to install the library is by cloning it directly from GitHub:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/rctn/sparsecoding.git
    cd sparsecoding
    pip install -e ".[all]"

The last command installs the dependencies required for the RCTN sparse coding library, including:

- ``numpy``
- ``scipy``
- ``matplotlib``
- ``torch``
- ``torchvision``
