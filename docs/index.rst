RCTN sparsecoding library documentation
#######################################

`sparsecoding`_ is a python library developed by the `Redwood Center for 
Theoretical Neuroscience (RCTN) <https://redwood.berkeley.edu>`_ which contains 
performant `pytorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`_ implementations of sparse coding dictionary learning, 
inference, and data processing. It was written to be a useful research tool 
for applying various sparse coding methods to data. 

We believe that sharing code within the scientific community is an important 
part of science and we hope that the research community finds this library 
useful.
